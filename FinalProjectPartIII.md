## Intended Audience
The social media audience is vast, considering the number of users it has. As identified in Part II of the project, this story applies to the general population, users, avoiders, and more.

The story paints a picture of the light and dark of social media, trying to tell a story of how users can balance their social media usage. This story still applies to everyone.

As majority of social media users are aged between 18 - 35, a majority of my user research was conducted on this audience, because it is likely to be more relatable to them.
