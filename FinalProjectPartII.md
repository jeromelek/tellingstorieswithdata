# Final Project Part II

## Outline
For my final project, I am inspired by the recent Netflix docu-drama, The Social Dilemma. The purpose of my project is to demonstrate that social media has its positives and negatives, but it is up to us, humans, to decide and control our choices and seek a balance of privacy and connectivity.

I want to show the increasing use of social media trends, as well as correlation to misinformation and health problems, but also to the benefits in productivity and efficiency. The Social Dilemma has shown a very one-sided dramatised story on the consequences of social media platforms, and I would like to present a more balanced argument.

In The Social Dilemma, the show featured several former employees of the big social media platforms, speaking out about the harmful effects of the platforms that they used to be a part of. It is a part of a growing trend that people are increasingly wary about the amount of control such platforms have over our lives, and thus some users might even choose to quit cold turkey. 

What I would like to show the audience is that as a reader, you can strike a balance between engaging and protecting oneself on such platforms, so as to use social media healthily and effectively.

Eventually, my call to action would be for people to monitor their use of social media through tools as well as limit their time spent. 


## User Story Arc Sketch
I debated between using the "dark" approach of "scaring" the user right from the start, akin to what was done in The Social Dilemma. However, I thought it would be more helpful to set a contextual stage first by talking about general ideas before deep diving into the topic.

## High Fidelity Mockup
Instead of sketching a paper prototype, I proceeded to design my mockup in high-fidelity using a prototyping tool known as Figma. Following this prototype, I intend to gather some feedback from viewers before proceeding to build the final version on shorthand.  View the initial mockup on Part 1 of the project here: [Part I](https://jeromelek.github.io/tellingstorieswithdataportfolio/FinalProjectPartI.html)

In part II of the final project, I have made iterative improvements over the original mockup above. This include the use of actual charts that have been created in Flourish, as well as including additional data and information that were suggested in an earlier peer review session. 
*Visualizations are now updated to be representative of the actual data.

## User Research and Interviews
With the new mockup, I proceeded to carry out the user research and interviews. The following is my user research protocol.

### Target Audience
My target audience is not exactly specific. It could apply to the general population, social media users, social media avoiders. By painting a picture of the light and dark, the purpose is to tell a story of balance, and thus it would generally apply to everyone. 

### Identifying Interviewees
Given the coronavirus situation, I have chosen 4 individuals that are more accessible for the purpose of gathering feedback on my story. They may or may not have watched The Social Dilemma and hence would provide a varied result. Also of interest to me is what kind of impact the show has had on their views. They also have varying social media usage patterns.
- Mid 20s Graduate Student who has watched The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is between 3-4 hours daily, with high usage of Facebook and Instagram.
- Early 20s Undergraduate Student who has watchehed The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is between 3-4 hours daily, with high usage of Instagram and Reddit.
- Early 20s Graduate Student who has not watched The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is approximately 2 hours daily, with high usage of Instagram and TikTok.
- Mid 20s Graduate Student who has only heard of the show. His Social Media usage is between 1-2 hours daily, with usage on Instagram and Reddit.

### Interview Script
The following is the script I have prepared to conduct the interview. The interviews were conducted in person as well as through video calls to walkthrough with them about the wireframe.

"Thank you for agreeing to participate in this interview. I am working on a story for a course that I am taking in school, and would like to gather some feedback from you with regards to your impressions and thoughts about the mockup. This interview will take about 10 minutes of your time."
I will proceed to share the mockup with them and give them a moment to view it. Follwing which, these are the following questions:
1. What do you think is the story being told?
2. Is there anything unclear and confusing?
3. Is there anything that stood out for you?
4. Is there anything that you would have liked to learn about from the story?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently about the overall story?
6. Does the story compel you to make any changes to your social media usage patterns?
7. Any Other Feedback

### Interview Findings
#### Interview #1 - Mid 20s Graduate Student who has watched The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is between 3-4 hours daily, with high usage of Facebook and Instagram.
1. What do you think is the story being told?  
  It is telling the reader the pros & cons of social media usage and urging the reader to reduce social media usage

2. Is there anything unclear and confusing?  
  Graphs were a little hard to read (labels might be a little too small)

3. Is there anything that stood out for you?  
  Number of installations of tiktok every minute

4. Is there anything that you would have liked to learn about from the story?  
  How social media has altered user's behaviors

5. Is there anything you would change or do differently about the overall story?  
  Nope
  
6. Does the story compel you to make any changes to your social media usage patterns?  
  Ensure that no compromising information about myself is posted online

7. Any other feedback.  
  Nil


#### Interview #2 - Early 20s Undergraduate Student who has watchehed The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is between 5-6 hours daily, with high usage of Telegram and Reddit.
1. What do you think is the story being told?  
  The story being told is that social media might be toxic even if it has its plus sides sometimes
  
2. Is there anything unclear and confusing?  
  Not really.
  
3. Is there anything that stood out for you?  
   The timeline about the data hacks. Shows that it seems to be an ongoing issue that is still continuing?
   
4. Is there anything that you would have liked to learn about from the story?  
  Nothing at the moment
  
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently about the overall story?  
  Too many charts and pictures in the story. Maybe you can cut out some?
  
6. Does the story compel you to make any changes to your social media usage patterns?  
  With the stats and everything, and it also tells me how to handle the toxic side of social media. I might have to look into it.
  
7. Any other feedback.  
  I think overall is quite good, I know what the whole story is about and I know why it says what it say.


#### Interview #3 - Early 20s Graduate Student who has not watched The Social Dilemma. Her Social Media usage is approximately 2 hours daily, with high usage of Instagram and TikTok.
1. What do you think is the story being told?  
  The story is about how social media impacts our lives, the pros and cons to it, and how it has helped us through coronavirus. It is about what social media can bring you and how you can protect yourself from it.
  
2. Is there anything unclear and confusing?  
  The chart on how Americans feel about social media during the pandemic - there was no legend, it took me much longer to understand what the chart was trying to say. Also, the first chart on youtube started in in 2018, I wasn't sure how come youtube started in 2018.
  
3. Is there anything that stood out for you?  
  That i'm wasting my life spending 3 hours a day on social media. It's also interesting to see how mental health is affected by social media.
  
4. Is there anything that you would have liked to learn about from the story?  
  Nothing at the moment
  
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently about the overall story?  
  Changes: Facebook and Instagram company colours can't really be seen on the charts (They do not stand out). The legends are abit small and hard to read, especially in grey. The font sizes need some working with because there aren't any parts ot the text that really stand out (They all look the same size)
  
6. Does the story compel you to make any changes to your social media usage patterns?  
  I guess the part on controlling your screen time would get me to check out the features that I have in my phone and monitor myself, but otherwise I think I don't use that much of social media.
  
7. Any other feedback.  
  I think the brain teasers are good, but they should stand out more.
  
  
#### Interview #4 - Mid 20s Graduate Student who has only heard of the show. His Social Media usage is between 2-3 hours daily, with usage on Instagram and Reddit.
1. What do you think is the story being told?  
  There are downsides to excessive social media usage.
  
2. Is there anything unclear and confusing?  
  Not sure what some of the stock images are supposed to do
  
3. Is there anything that stood out for you?  
  How to control social media usage, interesting information tidbits presented in the charts
  
4. Is there anything that you would have liked to learn about from the story?  
  Not really
  
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently about the overall story?  
  Maybe tell me about the impact of social media at the individual level earlier, since at the start it's mostly generalized information
  
6. Does the story compel you to make any changes to your social media usage patterns?  
  I will explore phone app limits functions in my personal device
  
7. Any Other Feedback.  
  Inspiring tagline at the end, charts were easy to read and understand the information it is presenting
 
  
### Changes to implement to address issues
Based on the feedback gathered, I would be implementing the following changes when transferring the mockup to Shorthand. Generally, the feedback has been quite positive after the changes have been made to the second iteration of the mockup. All the interviewees were able to interprete the story being told, and felt that the call to action was strong.

However, there were too many pictures and issues with the font size of the text vs the charts. I explained that this was a result of inserting screenshots into the mockup and thus causing this issue. It will definitely be rectified in the final product.

In summary, these are the changes that I would be looking into changing.
1. Reduce the number of image breakers (especially those that look too "stock" and not as linked to the story at hand.
2. Consider reducing the general statistics at the start, and putting the description above to make the chart more readable
3. Add legend to the visualization on American sentiments.
4. Work on the scaling between the chart font size and the text font size (this was not done in the mockup and caused some confusion - but will be rectified when implemented in shorthand)
5. Increase the font sizes of axis / labels to be more visible
6. Change the color of the axis from grey to white for better visibility
7. Look into alternative colours for Facebook / Instagram to make their lines more visible on the charts
8. Vary the font weight / sizes for the text blocks to increase readability and impact for the reader.
9. Provide more detail if possible with regards to the timeline (when readers want to find out more)

These changes will be made directly on Shorthand in Part III of the project for greater accuracy.
