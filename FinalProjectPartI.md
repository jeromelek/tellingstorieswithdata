# Final Project Part I

## Outline
For my final project, I am inspired by the recent Netflix docu-drama, The Social Dilemma. The purpose of my project is to demonstrate that social media has its positives and negatives, but it is up to us, humans, to decide and control our choices and seek a balance of privacy and connectivity.

I want to show the increasing use of social media trends, as well as correlation to misinformation and health problems, but also to the benefits in productivity and efficiency. The Social Dilemma has shown a very one-sided dramatised story on the consequences of social media platforms, and I would like to present a more balanced argument.

In The Social Dilemma, the show featured several former employees of the big social media platforms, speaking out about the harmful effects of the platforms that they used to be a part of. It is a part of a growing trend that people are increasingly wary about the amount of control such platforms have over our lives, and thus some users might even choose to quit cold turkey. 

What I would like to show the audience is that as a reader, you can strike a balance between engaging and protecting oneself on such platforms, so as to use social media healthily and effectively.

Eventually, my call to action would be for people to monitor their use of social media through tools as well as limit their time spent. 


## User Story Arc Sketch
I debated between using the "dark" approach of "scaring" the user right from the start, akin to what was done in The Social Dilemma. However, I thought it would be more helpful to set a contextual stage first by talking about general ideas before deep diving into the topic.

## High Fidelity Mockup
Instead of sketching a paper prototype, I proceeded to design my mockup in high-fidelity using a prototyping tool known as Figma. Following this prototype, I intend to gather some feedback from viewers before proceeding to build the final version on shorthand.

## Method and Medium
I plan to deliver the final project on Shorthand. From the demos provided, I think the platform is sufficient in allowing me to complete my illustrations from the initial sketches that I had.
I will use Flourish and Tableau to create the data visualizations. To supplement the visuals, I have also sourced my images from Unsplash.com for royalty free images, and will create additional graphics using Figma.
The images will depict common social media platforms, and stock images to tell a story.

The data visualizations will include maps, line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and other relevant visualizations.
