### Explanation & Comparison
In my third data visualization, I decided to go with a line chart with filters to allow a user to compare the data across countries that have been selected. The purpose in doing so is to tell a different story from the 1st Bar Chart, which showed how countries compared in a particular year (2017). The 2nd grid of line charts was very clear in showing how a country has performed over time, but is still a little harder to compare selected countries in different rows on the grid. Hence, I decided to create a line chart with the filter input options such that both lines can appear on the same chart, allowing for easy comparison.

The different methods of visualization work well in deliverying different messages, and actually serve different purposes. 
The bar graph is a good way for us to compare values between countries in a particular year.
The grid of line charts showed us how individual countries have performed over the years.
The line chart shows us how countries compare to each other over the years.
