A public portfolio for the Telling Stories With Data course.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Jerome. I am a student in the MISM (16 month) program. My pronouns are he/him/his.

I'm a Lego fan! That's how I would look like if I was a Lego minifigure. 
Post graduation, I hope to develop a career in building elegant solutions for users as a software engineer. 
You can also view a portfolio of my work here! [http://www.jeromelek.com](http://www.jeromelek.com)

## What I hope to learn
Through this course, I would hopefully be able to hone my skills in making better illustrations and visualizations that are attractive, yet easily understandable. Often in the world, we see many cases of poorly designed graphics that is more confusing than informative. Hopefully, through this course I would be able to learn the pitfalls and avoid such issues when it comes to my implementation!
