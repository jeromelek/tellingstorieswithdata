# tellingstorieswithdata portfolio
A public portfolio for the Telling Stories With Data course.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Jerome. I am a student in the MISM (16 month) program. My pronouns are he/him/his. 
Post graduation, I hope to develop a career in building elegant solutions for users as a software engineer.

## What I hope to learn
Through this course, I would hopefully be able to hone my skills in making better illustrations and visualizations that are attractive, yet easily understandable.
