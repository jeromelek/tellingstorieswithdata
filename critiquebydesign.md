I selected this data visualization because I am a huge soccer fan, and such visualizations have become so commonplace in the game. Every match report comes with a lot of game statistics, possession, shots, tackles, passes, and it intrigued me to think if I could design a visualization. Some websites do not even bother with this and displays them as a series of numbers in the table. As more and more complicated visualizations are done for greater in depth statistics, I wonder how might I display the simple things for the common man? On top of this, the choice of colors on this particular visualization triggered me into choosing it for this assignment.

## Thought Process
The process started with the use of Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, and the outcome of this exercise made me feel like the design of the visualization has to breed familiarity. Years of experiencing such design cues would cause a radically different design to be hard for a new reader to adapt to. Often, readers are interested in such data, and thus I would think that simplicity is key in this case. I could also argue that it is this reason that many resort to listing the statistics without any visualization at all.

The main issue that screamed out to me from these visualizations was the choice of colors. I understand that both teams have red as their home color, but it is precisely this reason why there are different coloured soccer kits for home and away games. It would be a disaster if all 20 players were wearing red, and thus, the chart shouldn't be all red either. Instead, I thought that we could use the colours that the teams wore for this match.

The second part about the goal attempts seems to attempt making a clever graphic out of a goal post design, but in doing so, the visualization did not provide any sense of scale.

The next issue I thought about was the corners and fouls bars looking like they added up to 100%, or weren't in some sort of scale. I don't think it should be showing a majority kind of comparison, and thus I thought this representation does not really help. 

So with these 3 issues that I felt needed changing the most, I began sketching out a low fidelity wireframe solution on paper.
